  - If you want to just use one, change the file name (ex.logo2.bmp to logo.bmp). Then overwrite the existing "logo.bmp" file in BOOT

Loading Screen:
  - You can only select one file to use, so pick one.
  - Rename it to "loading.jpg"
  - Overwrite the existing EASYROMS > launchimages > loading.jpg
